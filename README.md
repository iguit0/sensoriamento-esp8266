Real-time soil moisture sensing using NodeMCU and Firebase

## Abstract

Aiming to provide a better use of water, this work presents the development of a prototype for soil moisture monitoring using wireless technology and low cost materials. Soil moisture is a determining factor to provide acceptable conditions for the development of any cultivated vegetative system. Based on Internet of Things principles, the hardware consists of a ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller that controls a hygrometer sensor to collect soil moisture data. The management and control of states and information of these devices is done through a web application, which connected to a real-time database of Firebase platform enables efficient handling of water resources and enables remote monitoring of humidity. Data saved in the cloud is used to generate charts for studies by agricultural professionals.

*Key-words: Internet of Things, Soil Moisture, Smart Farming*
